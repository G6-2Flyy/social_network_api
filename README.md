## Social Network API

## Description

The purpose of this project is to create an API for a web-based social network application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. This application uses `Express.js` for routing, a `MongoDB` database, and a `Mongoose` ODM. Additionally, it uses `Day.js`` to format timestamps. `Insomnia` was used to create seed data for this application.

- This application solves the issues of speed and flexibility since it uses MongoDB. MongoDB is a top pick for many social networks due to its speed with large data sets and its flexibility with unstructured data.
